In a university setting, sleep is something that students often get little of, and stress is something that students have a lot of. Studies have proven that both less sleep and higher stress levels have negative effects on reaction time. Reaction time is important for the average student when crossing streets, driving cars, playing sports, participating in kahoot, etc. When it comes to lower reaction time, students often have a hard time focusing on their schoolwork. Which correlates directly to lower grades, and lower left-esteem.
