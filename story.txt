In a university setting, sleep is something that students often get little of, and stress is something that students have a lot of. Studies have proven that both less sleep and higher stress levels have negative effects on reaction time. Reaction time is important for the average student when crossing streets, driving cars, playing sports, participating in kahoot, etc. When it comes to lower reaction time, students often have a hard time focusing on their schoolwork. Which correlates directly to lower grades, and lower left-esteem. Through these factors combined students often lack the motivation to wake up early to go to morning classes. This defeats the purpose of college, which is the encourage the student to learn and broaden their knowledge. In constrast students feel like college is a constant battle for survival. However, it's hard to change this situation since the students have the responsbility to finish the homework and also have the stress of getting a better grade. All od these may result in the lack of sleeping time.
